## Using React Portals in NextJS

- use specific case: port a notification outside of the deep structure.
- why? to improve accessibility and semantics

### React Portal refresher

- in the component that must be rendered, import ReactDOM
- wrap the returned JSX with ReactDOM.createPortal()
- as second argument to createPortal, pass a selector that targets the element in which this component must be ported to
- this works even if the component is used in another component tree
