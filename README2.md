### A note about styling in NextJS

- The aproach .module.css is valid in NextJS
- When styling Links, there is the need to use an explicit internal anchor tag to apply the styles in this anchor tag
- Check the button component implementation and the placing of the props.children
- Take into account tha this approach does not require the addition of the href prop in the anchor tag, just use the href of the Link
